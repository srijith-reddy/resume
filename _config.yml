about_content: |
  I am a data analyst currently pursuing a Master’s in Statistics at Zicklin School of Business, with a strong foundation in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data-driven decision-making.

  My coursework and projects reflect deep experience in regression, multivariate methods, and advanced data mining using Python, R, and SQL. I am actively seeking roles in data science, statistical modeling, and quantitative research.

  My goal is to apply analytical thinking and technical expertise to solve real-world business problems and drive impact in data-intensive environments.
