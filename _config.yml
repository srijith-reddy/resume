about_content: |
 M.S. in Statistics & Data Science at Baruch College (Zicklin) and prior studies in Industrial Engineering (Penn State) and Investment & Wealth Management (Imperial College London). Experience in transforming messy data into clean, scalable systems — anywhere from multi-leveled quant pipelines for researching equities to AI agents that automate decisioning processes. 
 Proficient in Python, R, and SQL and exposure to machine learning, multivariate analysis, and fairness-sensitive modeling. I want to work on AI/ML engineering, data science, and applied AI research projects that bring intelligent systems and end-to-end real-world applicability together.
